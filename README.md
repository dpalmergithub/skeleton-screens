# skeleton-screens

##Info
We got tired of making Skeleton placeholders over and over again, so I decided to put them here and share them with everyone. Want to contribute, email me a link to you component, such as a CodePen link or something similar, and I'll add it in and reference the contribution within the component. Always open to criticism and improving the site so let me know. Right now it's a simple static site, but if traffic picks up and content becomes too much, I'll be looking to implement something different on a node server connected to a db.
